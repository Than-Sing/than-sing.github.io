<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a third year student from Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics. In the spring of 2024, I participated in the exchange program at the Department of Mathematics of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

During the undergraduate period, in order to cultivate my ability of analysis and modeling, I participated in several mathematical contests in my spare time. Here are some selected awards:
<ul style="line-height: 110%">
<li>The <u>Winning Prize</u> of 2024 S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest (Appl. & Comp. Math.),</li>
<li>The <u>Finalist Winner</u> of 2024 Mathematical Contest in Modeling (Top 3%),</li>
<li>The <u>First Prize</u> of 2023 Chinese Mathematics Competitions (Shanghai Division),</li>
<li>The <u>Second Prize</u> of 2023 Asia and Pacific Mathematical Contest in Modeling.</li>
<!-- <li>The Third Prize of 2022 China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling.</li> -->
</ul>


My research interests are mainly about
<span style="color: blue; font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold">
deep learning theory
</span>
and
<span style="color: blue; font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold">
optimization
</span>.
I am studying efficient algorithms in Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning under the guidance of [Prof. Zhenli Xu](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xuzl/). Moreover, I am also committed to studying the generalization of infinitely deep neural networks, as well as the equivalence of the width and depth of neural networks, under the supervision of [Prof. Fenglei Fan](https://fengleifan.github.io/Feng-Lei.Fan.github.io/about.html).
